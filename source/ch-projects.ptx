        <title>PreTeXt authoring system</title>
        <p>
<url href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</url>
is an authoring and publishing system for 
scholarly documents, especially in STEM disciplines.
Works authored in PreTeXt can be converted to HTML,
PDF, braille, and many other formats. This book was
written in PreTeXt!
        </p>
        <p>
PreTeXt is particularly well-suited for the creation of
interactive and accessible Open Educational Resources in
mathematics and computer science. Works authored in PreTeXt
can be deployed to
<url href="https://runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</url>,
allowing students to log into their textbook and persist progress
on exercises and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
The
<url href="https://prose.runestone.academy">PROSE Consortium</url>
forms the broader ecosystem serving open-source STEM open educational
resources and offers regular drop-in meetings for community members
to learn more about its products, which also include
<url href="https://openwebwork.org/">WeBWorK</url> and
<url href="https://www.doenet.org/">Doenet</url>.

<url href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/pretext-getting-started-2023">
    Getting Started with PreTeXt
</url> is a tutorial that uses GitHub Codespaces to get authors
up and writing quickly, and helps them share their works on
GitHub and GitHub Pages.

<m>\pi</m>-Base Community Database of Topological Counterexamples
        </title>
        <p>
To paraphrase Mary Ellen Rudin, <q>topology is a dense forest of
counterexamples, and a usable map of the forest is a fine thing.</q>.
The <url href="https://topology.pi-base.org/"><m>\pi</m>-Base</url>
aims to serve as this atlas, turning the classic text
<url href="https://zbmath.org/0211.54401"><pubtitle>Counterexamples
in Topology</pubtitle></url> into an open, living, and
interactive database supported
by a community of researchers, instructors, and students.
        </p>
        <p>
To learn how to contribute to the <m>\pi</m>-Base,
a <url href="https://github.com/pi-base/data/wiki/Tutorial">tutorial</url>
is available to walk through the process of editing its data and
previewing it in your own Codespace.

        <title>Lean Theorem Prover</title>
        <p>
The <url href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean theorem prover</url>
is an interactive proof assistant that allows mathematicians to formally
verify their proofs by computer.
        </p>
        <p>
The textbook
<url href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean?tab=readme-ov-file#to-use-this-repository-with-github-codespaces">
    Mathematics in Lean
</url>
provides an excellent introduction to authoring in Lean, with GitHub
Codespaces support.
        </p>
        <p>
(For a more casual experience outside GitHub, the
<url href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/">Lean game server</url> has fun
tutorials for both Peano axioms and naive set theory.)

        <p>
In December 2023, the American Institute of Mathematics
hosted a workshop of researchers to explore the future
of sociotechnical infrastructure for mathematics. One outcome
of this work was the establishment of
<url href="https://code4math.org"/>, a community for mathematicians
engaged in this work.

        <p>
The PROSE Consortium is a community of
instructors, developers, and researchers focusd on open-source
tools and resources for mathematics and computer science education.
You can engage with this group by visiting their homepage at
